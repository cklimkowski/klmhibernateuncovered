Hibernate Examplified using com.mysql.jdbc.driver to connect with MySQL

This examplifies how to: 
- configure *hibernate.cfg.xml* file to connect to db and set hibernate mapping resources such as *Event.hbm.xml*, *Person.hbm.xml*, *Ticket.hbm.xml*;  
- query db with **session.createQuery**
- persist data with **session.save**
- manage **one-to-many**, **many-to-many** relationships
- use **HQL**
- utilize **lazy-loading**.

This simple sample of what Hibernate can do is truely useful.
